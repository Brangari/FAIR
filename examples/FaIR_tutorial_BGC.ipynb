    "# FaIR v2.2 model - Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we are going to run a short tutorial using the FaIR v2.2 (Finite Amplitude Impulse Response) climate model. The intention today is to learn the basics of how climate modelling works and understand the key processes that link emissions to temperature change. We will not be running full high-resolution climate change simulations, as it would require longer runtimes and process understanding (things are complicated!). Instead, we will just focus on building some intuition and understanding of the core mechanics of climate modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "In climate modelling, scientists usually use full Earth System Models (ESMs) to simulate atmosphere, ocean, land, and cryosphere processes in three dimensions using physical equations resolved on spatial grids. ESMs are very powerful but also computationally expensive and complicated. FaIR v2.2 is something we call a simple climate model (SCM), which means it has the essential components of the climate system but in a reduced and computationally efficient form. Instead of high spatial resolution, we can compute the global-mean behaviour of the Earth system. Since it is very fast to run, it can be easily used to run many scenarios, explore uncertainty, and learn about how overall feedback between emissions and climate. Despite its simplicity, FaIR has been used in IPCC assessments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea behind FaIR v2.2 is that it links emissions to temperature change through a small set of equations (6). First, emissions of greenhouse gases (determined by you) are converted into changes in atmospheric concentrations considering how carbon and other gases are taken up by oceans and land over time. Second, concentrations are translated into radiative forcing (net change in the Earth's energy balance), which is the effect of these gases on how sunlight is absorbed and energy radiates back to space. Third, it determines the temperature of the system. The model is a bit more complicated than this, as there are a series of parameters accounting for feedbacks and process adjustments, but it can be considered rather simple. Despite it, the model captures the dominant behaviour of the global climate response on policy-relevant timescales, making FaIR an ideal tool for learning and understanding!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to know more about the model, check this paper by Leach et al., 2021: https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/14/3007/2021/.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some basics\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main parts to running fair. The first is setting up the problem definition. This tells fair what you are including in the run, how long you are running for, how many scenarios and how many (climate) ensemble members (known as configs).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting up the run\n",
    "\n",
    "First make a new instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from fair import FAIR\n",
    "f = FAIR()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we need to add some information about the time horizon of the model, forcers, climate configuration, and (optionally) some model control options:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from fair.io import read_properties\n",
    "f.define_time(2000, 2050, 1)\n",
    "f.define_scenarios(['abrupt', 'ramp'])\n",
    "f.define_configs(['high', 'central', 'low'])\n",
    "species, properties = read_properties()\n",
    "f.define_species(species, properties)\n",
    "f.ghg_method='myhre1998'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we tell fair to generate some empty (all NaN) array variables: emissions, concentrations, forcing, temperature etc.:\n",
    "```\n",
    "f.allocate()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That's all you need to set up the run.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fill in data\n",
    "\n",
    "The `f.allocate()` step creates `xarray` DataArrays, some of which need to be populated. For example, to fill a constant 40 GtCO2/yr emissions rate for fossil CO2 emissions into the 'abrupt' scenario, we can do\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from fair.interface import fill\n",
    "fill(f.emissions, 40, scenario='abrupt', specie='CO2 FFI')\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we also want to tell fair things such as the climate feedback parameter, carbon cycle sensitivities, aerosol forcing parameters, and literally hundreds of other things you can vary. There are convenience functions for reading in emissions and parameter sets from external files.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Run and analyse the model\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the model is run with\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "f.run()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Results are stored within the `FAIR` instance as `xarray` DataArrays or Dataset, and can be obtained such as\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(f.temperature)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple `scenarios` and `configs` can be supplied in a `FAIR` instance, and due to internal parallelisation is the fastest way to run the model (100 ensemble members per second for 1750-2100 on my Mac for an emissions driven run). The total number of scenarios that will be run is the product of `scenarios` and `configs`. For example we might want to run three emissions `scenarios` -- let's say SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0 -- using climate calibrations (`configs`) from the UKESM, GFDL, MIROC and NorESM climate models. This would give us a total of 12 ensemble members in total which are run in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommended order for setting up a problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, the recommended order in which to define a problem is set out step by step, and is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create the `FAIR` instance, initialised with run control options.\n",
    "2. Define the time horizon of the problem with `FAIR.define_time()`\n",
    "3. Define the scenarios to be run (e.g. SSPs, IAM emissions scenarios, or anything you want) with `FAIR.define_scenarios()`.\n",
    "4. Define the configurations to be run with `FAIR.define_configs()`. A configuration (`config`) is a set of parameters that describe climate response and species response parameters. For example you might have a `config` with high climate sensitivity and strong aerosol forcing, and one with low climate sensitivity and weak aerosol forcing.\n",
    "5. Define which `specie`s will be included in the problem, and their properties including the run mode (e.g. emissions-driven, concentration driven) with `FAIR.define_species()`.\n",
    "6. Optionally, modify run control options.\n",
    "7. Create input and output `DataArrays` with `FAIR.allocate()`.\n",
    "8. Fill in the DataArrays (e.g. emissions), climate configs, and species configs, by either working directly with the `xarray` API, or using FaIR-packaged convenience functions like `fill`, `initialise`, `f.fill_from_csv` and `f.override_defaults`.\n",
    "9. Run: `FAIR.run()`.\n",
    "10. Analyse results by accessing the DataArrays that are attributes of `FAIR`."
